## Investment Philosophy & Mental Model

> â€œA single clean ROE graph tells me more than a hundred cluttered indicators.â€

- Sees companies like people: character, resilience, growth under pressure.
- Hates noise and flashy charts â€” values clarity and fundamental insight.
- Believes in long-term theses, not short-term hype.
- Doesnâ€™t chase â€” she investigates.

##  What Frustrates Her

- â€œPE 98, ROE 3â€ stocks promoted like gold.
- Tools with data but no story or attribution.
- Dashboards that donâ€™t answer:
  > â€œIs my portfolio getting better or worse?â€

## What She Needs from the Platform

| # | Business Question                      | Why It Matters to Her                        | Platform Response                                                                 |
|---|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Which stocks are drifting from my thesis? | She protects her conviction, not her ego.     | Flags score drops due to ROEâ†“, D/Eâ†‘, or earnings shock                            |
| 2 | Are there hidden gems Iâ€™m missing?     | Seeks understated strength, not noise.       | Uses percentile logic to rank quality undervalued picks                           |
| 3 | Why did this score fall?               | Trust builds through transparency.           | Score attribution: â€œScore â†“ 0.3: ROE â†“ 2%, D/E â†‘ 10%â€                             |
| 4 | Is my portfolio quality improving?     | Trends matter more than moments.             | Shows PE/ROE evolution over time                                                  |
| 5 | Where should I spend my research time? | Hates wasting time on noise.                 | Weekly report with top movers, drift alerts                                       |
| 6 | Is any sector turning unhealthy?       | She watches systemic weakness.               | Sector score heatmaps & metric drift detection                                    |
